# Heart-disease
Heart disease prediction model using machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.

Implemented multiple classification algorithms - Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBOOST, LIGHTGBM, and Support Vector Machine.
Significantly increased the accuracy of the algorithms using hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.
Applied advanced techniques such as cross-validation, feature selection, and grid search to fine-tune model parameters for better performance.
Analyzed and preprocessed data to ensure quality and consistency, improving overall model reliability.
